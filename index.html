                <div class="content">
                    <p>Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows users to watch a wide variety of TV shows, movies, documentaries, and other entertainment content over the internet. It was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in the United States. Netflix has since become one of the world's leading and most popular streaming platforms.
                        Netflix has played a significant role in the shift towards online streaming as a primary way of consuming entertainment content, revolutionizing the way people watch TV shows and movies.

                        The cost of Netflix varies depending on the country, the specific subscription plan you choose, and any promotions or changes in pricing that Netflix may implement. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Netflix offered several subscription plans in the United States, which can give you an idea of the price range. Keep in mind that prices may have changed since then, so it's advisable to visit the official Netflix website or check with the service directly for the most current pricing in your region. Here are the typical Netflix subscription plans as of September 2021:

                    <p>You can watch Netflix on a variety of devices and platforms as long as you have a Netflix subscription and an internet connection. Here are some common ways to access Netflix:</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>After canceling, you can continue to use Netflix until the end of your current billing period. This means you can still watch movies and TV shows on Netflix until the next billing date, at which point your subscription will end, and you won't be charged again.

                        Keep in mind that the specific steps and options may vary slightly depending on your region and the device you're using to access Netflix. If you encounter any issues or have trouble canceling your subscription, you can contact Netflix customer support for assistance.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>However, it's important for parents and guardians to be aware of what their children are watching and to set appropriate viewing limits. While Netflix provides content ratings and parental controls, it's still a good idea for parents to preview content and make informed decisions about what is suitable for their children based on their age, maturity level, and family values.

                        Overall, Netflix can be a valuable streaming service for families with children, offering a wide range of entertaining and educational content in a controlled and ad-free environment.
